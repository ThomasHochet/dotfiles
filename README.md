## setup made in WSL2

### [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)
Simple fish config with personnal aliases

### Neovim
Config started with [Kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) to learn Neovim on my own. 
Very barebone config for my personnal enjoyment. 

### Theme used: [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)
